1. To maintain a fanout connection for each of the N clients there needs to be N 
alive connections persistently available. 

2. Client does not know about such connections so Producer.JS has to maintain 
all the connections all the clients.

3. Client maintains counter to inform the Producer of the next operation to receive

4. Producer maintains an array of pending operations for each receivingQueue

5. Producer when receives the counter from the client it sends all the pending 
operations from the array from index=counter to index=n. 

6. Producer has to keep tab of these operations for all clients and also has to 
flush out the sent operations time to time when all clients have recevied upto a 
particular operation.

7. Client will update counter by N only on successful receiving of N consecutive 
operations

8. As the Producer iteself is responsible to propagate the operations to all the 
clients the server might not need a fanout exchange.
